# lib-ass

Use Agile Scope Syntax (ASS) to describe and parse any syntax in a convenient nested structure.

ASS originated from (language-markdown)[https://atom.io/packages/language-markdown/] as a solution to make the automated testing of language-packs less dependent on Jasmine, faster and more flexible (due to re-usable nested elements), and frankly less tedious.
